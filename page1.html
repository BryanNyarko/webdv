   <h1 id="history">HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY GHANA</h1>
  
   <h1 id="intro">INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>
	   Ghana, a country located in the West African region of Africa is rich in culture and also multiple interesting historic events. 
	   The name Ghana was bestowed upon the Ghanaian people after the declaration of independence in 1957 by Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. Someone might ask, "what was the name of Ghana before colonization?".
	   Well, we will cover all that in later parts of this page.
	   We will take a deep dive into the various aspects of events hat occured to birth Ghana.
	</p><hr><br>
	
   <h1 id="origin">ORIGIN</h1>
	<p>
	   Ghana consists of many ethnic groups but the main ethnic groups that migrated into Ghana ultimately lead major historic events which will go on to play major roles in the making of "Ghana".
	   The ethnic groups that first settled in Ghana came from different geographical locations with different reasons for migrating into Ghana. 
	   A number of these ethnic groups migrated from the old Ghana Empire which covered areas presently occupied by parts of Mauritania, Senegal and Mali with the capital called Kumbi Saleh. 
	   These ethnic groups were the Akans, Ewes, Ga-Adangbe, Mole-Dagbon and Guans.
	   
	
	   <h3>HOW THE VARIOUS GROUPS MIGRATED TO PRESENT GHANA</h3>
	  <section>
	    <b>AKANS:</b>
		             The Akans constitute about 50% of the Ghanaian population.
	                 They are the largest ethnic group in Ghana. 
	                 They constitute of the Asantes, Denkyiras, Fante , Twifu, Adansi, Bono, Wassa, Sefwi, Akwamu, Akwapem, Aowin, Kwahu, Akyem, Assin.
	                 They main language of the Akans are twi and Fante.
	                 They are beleived to have migrated from the old Ghana Empire after it collapsed.
	                 They first settled in Techiman, Gyaman and Bono-Manso when they migrated to Ghana. 
	                 They moved between two rivers; River Comoe and Black Volta.
	                 They later moved from Techiman, Gyaman and Bono-Manso to A land between Pra and Offin rivers. 
	                 From Techiman, the Fantes moved to Mankessim led by Oburumankoma, Oson and Odapagyan. 
	                 Others moved to settle in the Forest to the East and the West; 
	                 these were the Akwamus, Denkyiras, Akwapem, Adansi, Assin, Wassa, Twifu and Sefwi.
	                 The Asantes moved to settle at Asante-Manso near Lake Bosomtwi.
	                 In present days, the Akans are found in within the middle belt in the Ghana.
	                 They practice the matrilinear system of inheritance.

		<b>EWES:</b> 
		             They are believed to have migrated from Ketu, a town in the South-Eastern part of the present day Republic of Benin,hat was around the 16th century.
		             From Ketu, they came to settle at Tado in Togo. Later they to Notsie still in Togo.
		             In Notsie, under the cruel leadership of King Agorkoli, he made them build a wall so they would not escape his cruel leadership.
		             They were finally able to escape by constantly watering a section of the wall until it became easy to bring down 
		             and since they didn't want to be traced from their footprints they walked backwards while migrating and this historic event is celebrated every year, it is caleled the "Hogbetsotso" festival.They left Notsie in three groups.
		             The first group was led by Amega Wenya and they settled around the keta lagoon. 
		             The second group settled around Ho.
		             The last group settled at Kpando. 
		             They practice the partrilinear system of inheritance.

		 <b>GA-ADANGBE:</b> 
		              The Ga-Adangbe consist of two tribes; the Gas' and the Adangbes'.
		              The Adangbes' comprises of the Ada, Krobo, Shai, Osudoku, Gbugbla, Kpone and Ningo. 
		              The Gas' are also the people of Accra and it's surroundings. The Ga-Adangbes' are believed to have migrated from Ile-Ife in the South-Western part of current Nigeria. 
		              They were led by their powerful king Ayi Kushi. 
		              The Gas' first settled at Okaikoi Hills near Nsawam.
		              In the 17th century, the Gas' built a powerful Ga state with its capital at Ayawaso. 
		              This state was built by king Okai Kwei. 
		              Accra became an imporant trading centre when the Europeans arrived.
		              So some of the Gas' moved  to thr coast to be able to have a direct trade with the Europeans.
		              The Adangbe first settled at Togo then moved to Agotime Kpetoe where they lived for some time.
		              Then after crossing Volta river they move southwards to the areas where they are found today.
		              The Adangbes' built a kingdom called ladoku kingdom which extended from Tema to the Volta river. 
		              In 1742, the Asantes defeated the Akyems and ruled both the Akyems and the Gas' until 1826 when the British defeated the Asantes.

		 <b>MOLE-DAGBON:</b>
               		   The Mole-Dagbon ethnic group is made up of the Mamprusi, Dagomba, Mossi and others. 
		               Apart from the Gonja people who came from Mande in senegal, all the Mole-Dagbon people came from the area around lake Chad.
		               The Mamprusi, Mossi and Dagombas trace their origin from a common ancestor.

		 <b>GUAN:</b> 
		               The guans were the first ethnic group to come to Ghana.
		               The are also believed to have come from the old Ghana Empire. Some historians also say they migrated to Ghana from Burkina Faso. 
		               They came to Ghana in three groups. 
		               The first group settled in the present Gonjaland and later defeated by the Gonjas. 
		               The second group settled in the Afram Plains and the third group settled in the lower volta basin.
		               The Guans were not in unison, this made it easy for their foes to defeat them. 
		               The language of the Guans is called Guan. Some of the Guans such as the people of Anum, Abiriw, Adukrom, Apirede, Aseseeso, Awukugua and Dawu live in the Akuapem mountains in the Eastern region. 
		               Some of them are the people of Anum and Boso on the north of Akosombo on the Eastern part of Lake Volta. 
		               Some are also in the Central region. These are the Awutu and Efutus.
		               Some also live in the Northern part of Volta region. They are the nyonka people. 
		               Some are also in the Eastern part of Brong Ahafo region such as the people in the sene District in the Brong Ahafo region.

		               These are the major ethnic groups that migrated to Ghana according to history. Most of the ethnic group migrated to Ghana because of 
		               trading activities, search for fertile land, peace and security, gain more territories and rapid population growth. 
		               We will move on to the coming of the Europeans after the arrival of the ethnic groups and the effect it had on present Ghana.

   <h1 id="arrival">THE COMING OF THE EUROPEANS, COLONIZATION AND INDEPENDENCE</h1> 
   <p>
   
    <p>
	   The Europeans began to arrive in Ghana in the 15th century, upon their arrival they named the land "Gold Coast",
       The name came about when the Europeans discovered alluvial gold in rivers and streams on the coast. 
	   The first Europeans to come to current Ghana were the Portuguese.
	   The portuguese came in the year 1471.
       They were sent by the Prince of Portugal called Prince Henry the Navigator to discover other lands and also resources, 
	   they were led by Don Diego D'Azambuga into Gold Coast.
       They first arrived in Adina and were met by the chief of the town then, Nana Kwamena Ansah. 
	   When the Portuguese arrived they discovered a lot of resources at Adina especially Gold.
       This inspired them to name the place "Da mina" which means "The mines" in English. 
	   They began batter trading with the Adina natives.
       And eventually decided to build castles and forts to store the resources they gained from trading with the people.
       This led to the building of the first castle, "Elmina Castle". 
       The Elmina castle was built in 1482 and it was the first European structure to be built outside Europe.
       The portuguese left in the year 1642 when they were driven away by the Dutch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
	   <br>
	   <section>
	          The second Europeans to arrive were the British and they arrived in the 16th century in the year 1553. 
	          They were led by Captain Windham. 
	          They also came to trade with the local people. 
	          They were the last to leave in the year 1957.
	   </section><br>
	   
	   <section>
		      The Dutch from Holland were the third to arrive and they arrived in the year 1595 also in the 16th century.
		      They drove away the portuguese in 1642 and they left in 1872.
	   </section><br>
		
	   <section>
		      In the 17th century, in the year 1642 the Danes from Denmark arrived and
		      they also went on to build the Christianborg Castle located currently in Osu.
		</section><br>
		
	   <section>
		       The Swedes from Sweden also came in the year 1647.
		</section><br>
	</p>
	
    <p>
	   The British were the only Europeans that stayed after arrival beacuse they wanted more of the raw materials. 
	   They ended up buying the forts and castles to store the raw materials they traded. 
	   The Europeans had the intention of trading with the local people hence the intoduction of the "barter trade"; 
	   which is the exchange of goods for goods.
	   They also introduced Christian missionaries and Education.<br>
		
	
	
	  <h3>THE MISSIONARY WORKS OF THE EUROPEANS</h3>
		  Before the coming of the Europeans, The people were not christians. 
		  They were believers of the African Traditional Religion. 
		  The Europeans introduced the Roman catholic, Anglican, Basel, Methodist and A.M.E missionaries. 
		    <section>
		    <b>THE ROMAN CATHOLIC:</b> The Roman Catholic came along with the Portuguese in the 1482. They were three priest. 
		    They left in 1642 when the Dutch drove them away. They later came back in the year 1880.
		    Two priest, Father Auguste Moreau and Father Eugene Morat were sent to the country again by the 
		    Society of African Missions to continue the good work which the Earlier Roman missionaries started.
		    </section><br>
			
			<section>
		    <b>THE ANGLICAN MISSIONARY:</b> In 1752 the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel sent Rev. Thomas Thompson to the Gold Coast. 
		    He worked in the Gold Coast from 1752-1756 converting the locals into Christianity. 
		    He left in 1756 with Philip Quacoe to be trained as a priest in England. Philip Quacoe came back in 1765 as a priest and a school master. 
		    He worked hard for the anglican church until he died in 1816.
		    </section><br>
			
			<section>
		    <b>BASEL MISSIONARY:</b> They arrived from Switzerland in 1827. The group was led by Rev. Andreas Riis.
		    He opened a mission station at Akropong Akuapim in 1835.
		    </section><br>
			
			<section>
		    <b>THE METHODIST MISSIONARY:</b> They arrived in at CapeCoast in 1835. They were led by Rev. Joseph Dunwell.
		    He died in 1837 and was replaced by Rev. Thomas Birch Freeman in 1838. He died in 1890.
		    </section><br>
			
			<section>
		    <b>AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL(A.M.E):</b> THe A.M.E missionary was led by Bishop J. Bryan Small.
		    They arrived in 1898 and started ther church in Keta.
			</section><br>
		  
		  <section>
		    The coming of the Europeans also brought about the building of schools to be able to train people for clreical work, priesthood and also to bridge the language barrier. 
			Therefore in 1848 the Basel Missionary opened a Teacher Training College in Ghana at Akropong Akuapim.
			Also, in 1876 the methodist school opened the first Secondary school in Ghana called Mfantsipim Secondary School. 
			The first government Secondary School in Ghana was established in 1924 by Governor Sir Gordon Guggisberg it was the Achimota School(Prince of Wales College). 
		  </section><br>
		  
		  <section>
		    The coming of the europeans had both positive and negative effects on the people of gold Coast; positives include the introduction of formal education, 
		    intoduction of Christianity, urbanization, introduction of currency and introduction of new crops. The negative effect we will elaborate on is colonization and slave trade.
		  </section> <br>
		  </p>
	
	<p>
	
	  <h3>COLONIZATION AND SLAVE TRADE</h3>
	   The Europeans came to colonize the people of Gold Coast and also introduced the Trans Atlantic slave trade. 
	   As the name suggests they were buying slaves from West Africa across the Atlantic ocean To America and West Indies to sell. 
	   The route of the trade was from Eirope to West Africa, from West Africa to North and South America (West Indies) and from West Indies to Europe.
	<figure>
	 <figcaption>TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE</figcaption>
	 <img src="TRIANGULAR SLAVE.jpg" width="350px" height="200px" alt="triangular slave trade">
	</figure><br>
			The Europeans started the slave trade beacause they discovered a new world(America) and they needed labourers to work on the plantations. 
			Unfortunately, another reason was the Africans themselves were ready to sell their own people as slaves. 
			The slaves were captured either by warefare, raiding or kidnapping vunerable members of different villages, 
			prisoners who were sering time for crimes were also sold as slaves and also through pawning were people were given out as 
            colateral for loan defaulters. The slaves were kept in slave farms and camps before their transatlantic journey. 
			These camps were headed by Europeans with African employees. Some of these slave camps were in Salaga in the Northern region and Assin Manso in the Central region.
            The slaves were kept in chains and were maltreated the woen were sometimes sexually assaulted. From slave camps they were marched in chains to the coast. 
			Afterwards, they were kept in Dungeons in the castles built at the Coast, they were then sipped on ships with chains on their legs to prevent them from escaping.<br>
	
			<b>THE ABOLITION OF SLAVE TRADE</b>
              Slave trade was abolished in Britain in 1807 through the abolition act passed by British
              In 1772, a run-away slave called James Somerset was brought to court in England charged for leaving his master called Charles Stewart unlawfully.
               A man called Granville Sharp defended Somerset.
              The Chief Justice of England at that time was called Lord Mansfield.
               Granville Sharp convinced the British Chief Justice, Lord Mansfield, to say that it was against the laws of England to keep slaves.
               So James Somerset was set free. 
               Therefore, with the help of Granville Sharp, William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson, the slave trade was abolished.
              These people who fought for the abolishment of the slave trade were called the Abolitionist.
               As a result, the freed slaves from Britain were assembled and shipped to Sierra Leone (Freetown) in 1787.
               Freed slaves from America were also assembled in Nova Scotia and Jamaica and shipped to a place near Freetown called Sherbo in Liberia.
              Freed slaves from Jamaica are generally called the MAROONS.
               Slavery was abolished in Gold Coast in 1874 and in America in 1865.
               It was also abolished in Denmark in 1803 and in Sweden in 1813.
               In the Netherlands, it was abolished in 1814 and in France in 1818.<br>
			   
			   <b>COLONIZATION OF GOLD COAST</b>
			   The Europeans came into the Gold Coast essentially for trade. 
			   At first these Europeans did not show that they wanted to rule the Gold Coast.
			   However, in 1821 Sir Charles MacCarthy was appointed as the first person to represent the British government in Gold Coast.
			   When he came he saw that trade was not going on well because there was no peace.
			   MacCarthy thought that the Asantes were worrying the Southern States because it was stronger.
			   He organised his soldiers to fight Asante to make it weak. 
			   But the Asante defeated the British at Adaamaso in 1824 and MacCarthy was wounded so he killed himself.
               In 1826 the British organised themselves and defeated the Asante at Akatamanso.
               However, the British government did not like these wars.
                The British thought they were in the country to trade and not to fight.
                Because of this the British government took away all British officials from the Gold Coast.
                The British traders wanted to stay on and trade, so they appointed their own leader in the Gold Coast.
                He was called Captain George Maclean.
                He arrived in the Gold Coast in 1830 to start work.
                Maclean was very clever at persuading people.
                It was captain George Maclean who actually used his cleverness to establish British power or rule in the Gold Coast. 
				The british colonized Gold Coast they wanted to prevent the French and Germans from influencing the Gold Coast so they can exploit the raw materials. 
				They were able to colonize the local people through agreement, war, persuation and madated territories.<br>

	   <h2>INDEPENDENCE</h2>
	    The push for independence from the British was a long and hard battle but before we dive into independence, 
	    lets take a look at various events that took place to form the urge for freedom from the British.<br>
	    
	    <h4>THE BOND OF 1844</h4>
	    This was a peace agreement signed by Commander Hill on behalf of the British government and the people of southern Ghana.
	    At first 8 chiefs signed the agreement but later grew to 11 chiefs. It was signed on 6th March 1844. 
	    In the agreement, the chiefs agreed that human sacrifice was bad and had to be stopped. 
	    They also agreed that criminal cases should be judged by both the chiefs and British judges. 
	    The British also agreed to protect the southern states from any external attacks particularly from the Ashantis.<br>
	    
	    <h4>THE POLL TAX ORDINANCE</h4>
	    It was a alw passed by the British in 1852 which compelled the people under the British protection to pay a tax of one shilling per year. 
	    This was to enable the British pay people who worked fr themIt was stopped in 1862. 
	    This was stopped because the people stood against it and it led to the formation of the Fante confederation. 
	    Which was the beginning of the cry and the fight for freedom from the British.<br>
	    
	    <h4>THE FANTE CONFEDERATION</h4>
	    This was a resistance movement formed in 1868 to resist to control and manipulation of the British. 
	    It was formded by some of the southern states and it had it headquaters at Mankessim. 
	    it was mainly formed to oppose the British and to hold them accountable for failure to fulfill what they promised.

	    </figure><br>
	    
	    <h4>THE SANGRENTI WAR AND YAA ASANTEWAA WAR</h4>
	    This war was fought between the Ashantis and the British. 
	    The war was named after the leader of the British Sir Garnet Wolsely but because the people could not mention it properly, they called the war "Sagrenti war". 
        The Ashantis wanted to rebuild their empire so the AshaNtis attacked the coastal states and lost the war because the British fought alongside the coastal states. 
        In 1900, Yaa Asnatewaa a Queenmother in Ejisu inspired the Ashantis to go into war against the British again. 
        The war was named after her. Eventhough the Ashantis lost the war she still became a role model to many.

      <h4>THE FORMATION OF UGCC</h4>
	   In 4th August 1947, the first political party in Ghana was formed.
	   This party was called the United Gold Coast Convention Party (UGCC).
	   Those who formed the party were George Grant (Leader), Dr. J. B. Danquah, Obetsebi Lamptey, Ako Adjei, E. A. Akuffo Addo, R. S. Blay, R. A. Awoonor Williams and E. A. William Ofori Atta.
	   It was formed at Saltpond.
	   Its motto was "Self Government within the shortest possible time".
	   Meaning they wanted to take government from the British by gradual process.
	   In December 1947, Nkrumah upon the recommendations from Ako Adjei was invited from London to become the first General Secretary of the party.
	   The UGCC wanted to achieve te following;<br>
	   <b>i.</b>They wanted to take over ruling of the country from the hands of the Europeans by gradual and legal means.<br>
       <b>ii.</b>They wanted Ghanaian leaders to be fully ready to take over all aspects of government from the British.<br>
       <b>iii.</b>They wanted to achieve constitutional progress for the Gold Coast through legal means.<br>
        Upon formation the UGCC were able to acheive the following;<br>
	  <b>a.</b> For the first time the people of Ghana began to see the need to regain independence for the country as a problem for everybody. This was because of the UGCC political education<br>
      <b>b.</b> The party gave chance to the educated Ghanaians to come together to oppose British colonial rule. <br>
      <b>c.</b> It established a newspaper known as the "Talking Drum" to help inform the people about what was happening in the country. <br>
      <b>d.</b> It used peaceful method to ask for self-government from the Europeans.  <br>
      <b>e.</b> It was the first political party in the country. So it introduced party politics in the country.<br>
      <b>f.</b> The UGCC brought Kwame Nkrumah to Ghana who later gained independence for the country.                                   <br>
      <b>g.</b> The leaders of the UGCC played an important role in writing of the 1951 Arden Clark constitution of Ghana.              <br>
      <b>h.</b> It made the British government to set up the Watson Commission which made an enquiry into the causes of the 1948 riots.<br>
	  
	  <h4>1948 RIOTS</h4>
	 Between 1939 and 1945, Ghanaian soldiers fought in the second world war at Burma and other places to help Britain fight for freedom and democracy.
	 Britain promised to give them much money after the war.
	 After 1945, the soldiers returned to Ghana. They were called "Veterans".
	 They faced many problems when they came to Ghana.
   	 Many of them could not get jobs to do.
     Others had no houses to sleep in.
	 They were not paid their pension pay which the British government promised them before the war.
     So on 28th February 1948, a group of the old soldiers were given permission to go to the castle to complain to the governor about how they were suffering.
     At the Christianborg cross road near the Independence Square, a British Senior Police officer called Major Imray ordered them to stop but they refused.
	 So he ordered his men to shoot at them.
	 Three (3) of the veterans were killed and many of them wounded.
	 The three who died were Private Odartey, Corporal Attipoe and Sergeant Adjetey.
	 The shooting made many people angry.
	 This led to serious riots and disturbances in Accra and other towns in Ghana. 
	 People went about looting and burning shops which were owned by Europeans. 
	 Many people were killed.
      Even though the leaders of the UGCC were not the people who planned the riots, the governor put the blame on them.
	 Six (6) of them were arrested and put in different prisons in the Northern, Upper East and Upper West regions for about eight (8) weeks.
      Those who were arrested were: Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, Dr. J. B. Danquah, Ako Adjei, Obetsebi Lamptey, Akuffo Addo and Ofori Atta.
	 The arrest made the leaders popular because the people said they were arrested because of their love for their country.
      Because of this they were called "The Big Six". 
	 The 1948 riots had the follwing effects on building the Nation;<br>
      <b>i.</b>It increased the level of political awareness among Ghanaians, Ghanaians saw that they had to struggle hard for independence.                                   <br>
      <b>ii.</b>It led to the arrest of the Big Six which made them popular,Some of them later used the popularity to gain independence for the country.                       <br>
      <b>iii.</b>It led to the formation of the Watson Commission which gave birth to the Coussey Committee that drew up the 1951 constitution to change the 1946 Constitution.<br>
      <b>iv.</b>It led to Nkrumah breaking away from the UGCC to form the CPP which later gained independence for the country.<br>
				
      <h4>FORMATION OF THE WATSON COMMISSION</h4>
	  After the 1948 riots, the British government sent a group of people to Gold Coast to find out the causes of the riots and to give recommendations for its solution. The group was known as the "Watson Commission". This was because the leader of the group was called Andrew Aiken Watson.
      The Watson Commission completed its report and made several recommendations which later helped the country to gain independence.Reasons For The Watson Commission
      The Watson Commission was set up to go into the 1948 disturbances that took place in the Gold Coast (Ghana) and to make recommendations.
      Recommendations of the Watson Commission
      The Watson Commission recommended that:<br>

      <h4>THE COUSSEY COMMITTEE</h4>
     In 1949, the governor of Gold Coast, Sir Charles Noble Arden Clarke who replaced Sir Gerald Creasy set up the coussey committee to prepare Ghanaians to serve their country and to take government from the British.
	 It was made up of thirty-nine (39) men.
     They were all Ghanaians. 
	 Its leader was called Sir Henley Coussey. 
	 This committee included all the members of the "Big Six" except Dr. Kwame Nkrumah.
	 Its main duty was to study the Waston Commission report and to draw up a new constitution.
     It started its work on January 20th 1949 and finished on 26th October 1949.

     <b>v.  </b>They suggested that Ghana should practice a Bi-cameral legislature (two houses) of parliament. <br>

     <h4>FORMATION OF CPP</h4>
     The Convention Peoples Party (C.P.P) was formed on 12th June 1949 by Dr. Kwame Nkrumah as a breakaway party from the U.G.C.C. 
	 It was the second major political party to be formed in Ghana.
	 The Leadership of the CPP Included the following:
     Dr. Kwame Nkrumah - Chairman, K.A. Gbedema - Vice Chairman Kojo Botsio - General Secretary, N. A. Welbeck-Propaganda Secretary, Dzenkle Dzewu - Financial secretary, Kwesi Plange, Krobo Adusei,Kofi Baako, Ashie Nikoi.
     The motto of the C.P.P was "Self government now".
     Aims or Plans or Objectives of the C.P.P. was,
     To get "Self-government now" for the people of Gold Coast,
     To work and maintain unity for the people of Gold Coast,
     To work for better conditions of service for Ghanaians so that Ghanaians will be happy at their work places,
     To help other colonies in West Africa to free themselves from colonial rule.<br>
         Achievements of the C.P.P;
     The C.P.P provided good leaders in the independence struggle for the Gold Coast,
     It gained independence for Gold Coast in 1957,
     It united all Ghanaians and gave them political education on the evils of Colonialism and the bad aspect of the 1946 constitution,

     The C.P. P gave fee-free primary education to all children of school going age under the 1951 accelerated education plan,
     It helped other countries to gain independence such as Togo, Mali and Guinea.<br>
     
     <h4>POSITIVE ACTION</h4>
     Soon after the publication of the Coussey Committee's report, Nkrumah called all groups and associations in the country to a meeting in Accra to discuss the report.
	 The meeting was called the "Ghana People's Representative Assembly".
	 He told them that the report was not good because it did not give political power to Ghanaians.
	 The Assembly wrote a letter to the governor that the people of Ghana should be granted immediate self-government.
	 They also said that Ghanaians as a whole did not accept the Coussey report.
	 The governor refused to say anything about the request.
	 On 15th December 1949, Nkrumah and the C.P.P. wrote to the governor stating that if by two weeks they did not receive any reply from the governor, they will declare a "Positive Action".
	 The "Positive Action" was a nationwide political strike and boycott.
	 By this, workers would not co-operate with the colonial government.
     The governor did not reply. So on 9" January 1950, Nkrumah declared the "Positive Action".
	 It led to some riots and Nkrumah and the C.P.P. leadership were arrested and sent to prison.<br>

     <h4>1951 GENERAL ELECTION</h4>
     The 1951 General Election in Ghana
     Based on the Coussey Committee's report, a new constitution was drawn up in 1950.
     The constitution came into force in January 1951. 
	 Under this constitution, parliament was made up of 84 members with a speaker of parliament.
	 Out of the 84 members, 38 were to be elected directly by the people while 37 were to be elected by chiefs and traditional council. 
	 3 members representing European mining interest, 3 members representing European trading interest, 3 ex-officio members 'appointed by the governor.
     The executive council had 11 members. 
	 9 out of the 11 members in the executive council were Ghanaians. <br>
	 The remaining 3 were:<br>
     • The Secretary of Defence and External Affairs<br>
     • The Secretary of Finance<br>
     • The Secretary of Justice.<br>
     Soon the governor announced that there were to be a general election on 8th February 1951 based on this new constitution.
	 In this first general election, the C.P.P, U.G.C.C. for the 38 seats.
     And some Independent candidates (who did not belong to any political party) contested.
     Even though Nkrumah and his C.P.P. leaders were in prison, they were allowed to contest for the election.<br>
	 The results were as follows:<br>
	 <table>
	  <tr>
	   <th>POLITICAL PARTY</th>
	   <th>RESULTS</th>
	  </tr> 
	    <tr>
		 <th>C.P.P</th>
		 <td>34</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		 <th>U.G.C.C</th>
		 <td>3</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		 <th>Independent</th>
		 <td>1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		 <th>Total</th>
		 <td>38</td>
		</tr>
	 </table>
  
     The Governor Sir Charles Noble Arden Clarke then brought Nkrumah out from prison on 9th February, 1951 and asked him to form his government. 
	 Nkrumah himself was given the post of Leader of Government Business and in March 1952, he became the first Prime Minister in Ghana.
     Reasons why the C.P.P. and Nkrumah won the first General Election:<br>
    <b> 1.</b> The reduction of the voting age from 25 to 21. This gave the youth who supported the C.P.P the chance to vote.                   <br>
    <b> 2.</b> The C.P.P's slogan was "Self-goverment now while the U.G.C.C was asking for "Self government within the shortest possible time"  <br>
    <b> 3.</b> The charisma of Nkrumah. He was a charismatic and charming leader.                                                               <br>
    <b> 4.</b> Nkrumah's organisational ability. He opened branches in all regions of the country for the C.P.P.                                <br>
    <b> 5.</b> The C.P.P was a mass party while the U. G.C.C was for only the educated Ghanaian and the chiefs.                                 <br>
    <b> 6.</b> Women and the Youth also supported the C.P.P to win.                                                                             <br>
    <b> Importance of the 1951 Elections</b>                                                                                                     <br>
    <b> 1.</b> It was the first time Ghanaians were given the chance to choose their own leaders directly.                                       <br>
    <b> 2.</b> It helped to elect leaders who later gained independence for the country.                                                         <br>
    <b> 3.</b> It brought all Ghanaians together to decide on an important National issue for the first time.                                    <br>
    <b> 4.</b> It increased the political awareness of the people at that time since the candidates organised rallies and campaigned to Ghanaians.<br>
     
    <h4>1956 PLEBISCITE</h4>
    A Plebiscite is defined as the direct vote of all men and women of voting age on a important question for a "Yes" or "No" response.
    The British administered what was known as "British Togoland (Now Volta Region) after the Germans were defeated in the first World War which was started in 1914 and ended in 1918. 
	When the British were about to leave the Gold Coast (Ghana) in 195) they organised a plebiscite on 9th May 1956 to see whether the people of the British Togoland wanted to join Ghana or not.
    As a result a plebiscite commissioner called Espionoza Y. Prieto was appointed to supervise this voting.
	His duty was to make the people understand what they were voting for.
    Two main political parties took sides in this plebiscite. The C.P.P stood for unification with independence Ghana while the other party called the Togoland Congress (TC) stood for separation of British Togoland from Ghana.
    The results were as follows:
    93, 095 people representing 58% voted for unification with Independent Ghana while
    67,492 people representing 42% voted against it. 
	Since majority of the people voted to join Ghana then British Togoland (Volta Region) became part of Ghana through the plebiscite.
    <b>Importance of the 1956 Plebiscite</b>                                                                                       <br>
    <b>1.</b> It made it possible for the people of Volta region to be part of Ghana, hence increasing the size of Ghana.          <br>
    <b>2.</b> It also helped to construct the Volta dam since it would have been divided if Volta region were not part of Ghana.   <br>
    <b>3.</b> Cocoa and other resources from the Volta region has helped to develop Ghana.                                         <br>
    <b>4.</b> It helped to bring unity among the people of the colony, Ashanti, the Northern territories and the British Togoland. <br>

    <h4>INDEPENDENCE AND THE AFTERMATHS</h4>
    Even though Ghana achieved internal self-government in 1951 which made Ghanaians had more control over the affairs of their country yet they struggled to regain full Independence.
	This was because those aspects of government which the British controlled were the most important for the development of the country.
	Eg. The British still chose the people to be in charge of the country's money and army.
	They chose someone who was to be in charge of how our country should relate to other countries.
    Moreover, the governor still had more power than everybody else in the government.
    Nkrumah and his government continued to improve upon the lives of the people by providing them with social services like schools and hospitals yet,
	some people did not like the way Nkrumah was running the country because, They felt that their regions were not being given a fair share of what belonged to them, 
	They also did not like the unitary system of government which Nkruman was running, 
	They preferred a federal form of goverment. Because of these disagreements, political parties were formed in the country.
	
    <h4>NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT (NLM)</h4>
    The National Liberation Movement (NLM) was formed by Baafour Osei Akoto on 19th September 1954 at Kumasi.
	This party was strong in Ashanti and Brong Ahafo regions.
    Northern Peoples Party (NPP) was also formed by Amadu Baba.
	It was also strong in the Northern and Upper Regions.
	As regional parties, the NLM and NPP wanted regional governments.
	They wanted federal government, which means each region should have its own government and control its own affairs.
	However on matters concerning foreign affairs, finance and some other important internal matters should be controlled by the central government in Accra.
    To them the development of each region should be the responsibility of the regional government.
	Because of this disagreement between the CPP and the regional parties on the form of government Ghana should have, the governor told Nkrumah to hold another general election on 17th July, 1956.
    All opposing parties, that is the NLM, NPP and the other smaller parties came together to form what they called The United Party (UP)". 
	This U.P. was headed by Dr. K.A. Busia. 
	So the 1956 election was between the CPP and the U.P. 
	There were 104 seats to de contested for in parliament.
	Any member who had more than 50%, that is half of the seats was to form a government and lead the country to Independence.
	The CPP won 72 seats while the UP had 32 seats.
    Nkrumah was therefore asked to form a government based on the Unitary system.
	6th March 1957 was chosen as Ghana's independence day because, the Bond of 1844 which started British influence on Ghana was signed on 6th March.
	Ghana, therefore, became Independent on 6th March, 1957.
	Ghana became a member of the United Nations Organization. 
	Dr. Kwame Nkrumah was the first African Prime Minister to attend the conference of Commonwealth Ministers in London. 
	Ghana became republic on 1st July 1960.
	
    <h4>IMPORTANT NATIONAL SYMBOLS, ARTEFACT AND EVENTS </h4>
	 The night of the independence declara was a memorable one where Nkrumah gave his popular speeach. 
	 The night was coupled with tears of joy and music from the late E.T Mensah "The King of African Highlife".<br>

		 <b>The Coat of Arms</b><br>
		 The Coat of Arms is the emblem or badge of the nation.
		 The Ghana Coat-of-Arms was designed by Mr.Amon Kotei a Ghanaian.
		 It is found on all government letter heads.
		 It is used by the government, the ministries and Government departments only.
		 It is a shield which carries the colours and the symbols of the traditions and hopes of the nation.
         When you see the Coat-of-Arms on anything you know, that thing belongs to the people of Ghana
		 i.e. it belongs to the nation.<br>

		 In the topright-hand corner, there is a castle and the waves of the sea,
		 The castle stands for the country's central goverment which was brought to Ghana by the white man from overseas and it works for ruling the whole country.
		 
         In the top left-hand corner are the Staff and sword of a chief. 
		 They are the symbols of a chiefs power or authority.
		 The staff and sword stands for local government in the country they tell us the chiefs were ruling before the Europeans came.
		 They also show us thr importance of our chiefs.
		 
         In the bottom left-hand corner, there is a cocoa tree: The cocoa tree stands for Ghana's agricultural wealth.
		 
         In the bottom right-hand corner, there is a shaft of a mine.
		 The shaft stands for Ghana's mineral wealth.
		 It tells us that Ghana has many minerals which are very important to the nation.
         
         The Gold lion in the middle of the shield stands for the continued link between Ghana and the British government. 
		 The link is that Ghana is a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.
		 
         The Green Cross in the shield tells us that all the people of Ghana must live together in peace.
		 
         Two eagles carry the shield, the eagle is a very large and strong bird.
		 It is called "King of Birds".
		 This is because it is strong and powerful.
		 If two eagles are carrying our Coat-of-Arms, it means our independence is in safe hands.
		 So the two eagles stand for a protector with strength, very clear and attentive eyes keeping watch over the country.
		 The eagles are proudly wearing black star medals suspended from a ribbon of Ghana colours: red, gold and green.
		 This also tells us that we must be proud that we are Africans.
		 
         There is a wreath on the top of the shield: The wreath is woven in the colours of Ghana.
		 The Black five pointed star rimmed with gold stands on the wreath. 
		 It stands for the lonestar of African freedom. 
		 The motto of Ghana is "Freedom and Justice". 
		 We find this motto under the shield in our Coat-of-Arms, This means that Chanaians are free and independent people.
		 The motto helps us to do great thins just as footballers are encouraged by their mottos such as "Never say Die",
         "Fabulous"
         and "Hala Madrid".
		 Whenever the players hear the supporters shouting these words, they are moved to die for their teams, we must be moved by our motto "Freedom and Justice" to do great things for Ghana.

         When the speaker is in the chair, the Mace stands upright or perpendicular indicating the formal proceedings in the house.
         However, during the consideration stage of a bill, the Mace is tilted towards the chair indicating the informal nature of the proceedings.

		 <b>Our currencies</b><br>
		 As we have seen, a national flag stands for a country. 
		 Coat-of-Arms and the National Anthem also stand for a country.
		 Currencies too stand for countries.
		 Remember we use the word currency for the money used in a country. 
		 Every country has its own money.
         Usually, the money of a country is used in that country only.
		 Currencies are usually made up of notes and coins.
		 In Ghana, the notes are called Ghana Cedis (GH¢) while the coins are called Ghana pesewa (GH P).
         We use the Ghana cedis and Ghana pesewa only in Ghana.<br>
